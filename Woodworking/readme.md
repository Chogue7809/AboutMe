# Woodworking

I enjoy the art of woodworking. I find it to a great way to relieve stress from day to day life. 
I wouldnt call myself a master woodworker, but I can create some very nice pieces with the skill that I do poses.
My love for wood working began very early on while I was doing construction with my father.
I then carried that love to wood shop when I was in school. I now enjoy creating what ever I can when I have the free time. 
I also get excited when friends are like I want this. I jump at the opportunity to be able to create something for them.

Although I dont have many picture, I have a couple of projects I was able to do for friends. One is a harpsicord so my friend could put a keyboard in to play at the renfest, and the other is a work in progress of a custom studio desk.
