>The main reason I am pursuing a degree in IT is because I love computers. I enjoy building custom computers, learning about new tech, and playing games.
Although with work and school I havent had much time for anything other than homework. ðŸ˜†

 >Also recently due to the pandemic I recently started a Twitch chanel as a way to entertain people. I have had much time since the start of the semester. Hopefully things will start getting a little less hectic and I can start back up again.
